# Data-analysis-Common-English-Words
Use various datasets on Kaggle, then aggregate, clean, and analyze them to gain insights into how natives learn and use these words in writing and verbal communication
## Project Objective:
- Explore and gain insights into how the natives use common English words daily and the distribution of the structures of words.
## Method used:
- Data cleaning
- Prepare data
- process data
- Data analysis
- Data visualization
## Tool used:
- Python
## Datasets information
- Using datasets from different sources on Kaggle.
  df1 contains words and the frequency of them.

  df2 includes words ordered by ascending alphabet and the examples in the contexts

## After cleaning each data, joining them into a united file, create some essential metrics to figure out insights from them. 
- Using syllapy lib to create a new column of syllable words
- Using nltk lib to create a new column named pos_category representing parts of speech
- Using eng_to_ipa lib to create a phonetic column
### Analyzing and visualization
1. syllable category

The highest frequency of words used by the native speakers is 2-syllable.

It is directly proportional to the number of distinct syllable words that more words in the list are classified into 1-syllable and 2-syllable.

2. By lexical word (part Ã² speech)

Plot a bar chart with stacks representing the syllables, and we can see Noun is the largest group in the list.
To be more clear, I created a heatmap chart.

The heatmap shows more information about the relationship and distribution of two variables
